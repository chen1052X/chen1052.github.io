        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            After graduating from Newcastle University with a degree in <strong>journalism</strong>, I embarked on a journey to establish myself in the media landscape. Initially, I aimed to become a journalist, but I soon discovered my luck in public relations, where I found better professional opportunities. As my career evolved, I transitioned into copywriting, allowing me to blend creativity with strategic communication.

            During the pandemic, I became a full-time freelancer, which offered me the flexibility to work on both writing and media anlysis. However, the emergence of <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> technologies disrupted my workflow, leading me to reevaluate my career path. Recognizing the need to adapt to this changing landscape, I sought new space for growth and learning.

            This quest for a renewed career opportunity led me to sign up for the interactive media course at Algonquin College. Here, I aim to retrain my skillset in media production and web development, preparing myself for a future that integrates traditional communication with technology.

            Here is my motivational quote: <strong>"Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success. If you love what you are doing, you will be successful."</strong> â€” Albert Schweitzer
