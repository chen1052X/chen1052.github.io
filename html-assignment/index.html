        <h2>About Me</h2>
    
    <p>Born and raised in China with an undying passion for language learning and a creative mind, I initially strove to train myself to be a bilingual journalist as a media student but found my way into the PR industry after graduation. My first job opportunity gained me a reputation in my team as a fast learner and professional copywriter, but it didn't offer a clear pathway for my future career outlook. So, I resigned from the company where I worked for two years and decided to try freelancing as a digital writer and media analyst.</p>
        
    <p>Despite hitting many barriers in the first few months, which made me think I might eventually need to find a "real job" to secure a healthy income, the pandemic actually landed me in a fortunate position, which allowed me to work from home while earning more money than I expected. However, the rise of <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr>, coupled with the gloomy post-pandemic economic landscape that hit many businesses around the world, has created another turning point for my work, as I came to realize that it will not provide an infinite number of gigs that are gradually taken over by <abbr title="Large Language Models">LLMs</abbr>. This is the reason why I am here, studying at Algonquin College, to see if I can unlock my talent in interactive media development.</p>
    
    <p>As for my favorite quote, it really took me a while to choose one (sorry, not a big fan of motivational quotes). I eventually settled on two lines of lyrics from a song by Accusefive, a Taiwanese band. Though not motivational, these lyrics resonate deeply, capturing the essence of some people's experiences in romantic relationships. I chose these because I think the songwriter is very creative.</p>

    <p>It goes like this:</p>

    <blockquote>

        Some are born to live without restraint,
        where every greeting becomes a true love's claim.
        Some are born to live for just one soul,
        while all goodwill is turned away at the gate.
        - Accusefive
