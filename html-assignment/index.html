        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            After graduating from Newcastle University with a degree in <strong>journalism</strong>, I embarked on a journey to establish myself in the media landscape. Initially, I aimed to become a journalist, but I soon discovered my true calling in public relations, where I found greater professional opportunities. As my career evolved, I transitioned into copywriting, allowing me to blend creativity with strategic communication.

            During the pandemic, I embraced freelancing, which provided me with the flexibility to work on diverse projects. However, the emergence of <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> technologies disrupted my workflow, leading me to reevaluate my career path. Recognizing the need to adapt to this changing landscape, I sought new avenues for growth and learning.

            This quest for innovation and development led me to enroll in an interactive media course at Algonquin College. Here, I aim to enhance my skills in digital storytelling and media production, preparing myself for a future that integrates traditional communication with cutting-edge technology. With each step, I remain committed to evolving as a professional and exploring the exciting intersections of media and technology in our increasingly digital world.
