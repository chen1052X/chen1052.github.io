                <dd>Web Development allows me to learn the basic coding language to set up simple web pages with a clear structure containing text and images.</dd>

                <dt>Graphic Design</dt>
                <dd>The course teaches me to use the "pen" tool, enabling me to draw cartoon characters. Although it only scratches the surface of graphic design, it shows me how sophisticated digital images are generated with Adobe software</dd>

                <dt>Moodboard</dt>
                <dd>Moodboards carry huge significance during the design process. They allow designers to convey their ideas, alongside colors and other important visual elements to be used in the final design.</dd>

                <dd>The photography class shows me how a camera works in manual mode, as well as the key points to consider when capturing an ideal image in a challenging setting.</dd>

                <dt>English</dt>
                <dd>I'm no stranger to the language, but there's still room for improvement. Immersing myself in an English-centered learning environment allows me to enhance my language skills significantly.</dd>
